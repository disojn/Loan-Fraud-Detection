# Loan-Detection:
PeerLoanKart is an NBFC(Non-banking Financial Company) that facilitates peer-to-peer loan.It connects people who need money(borrowers) with people who have money(investors). An investor would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.I am creating a model that will help predict whether a borrower will pay the loan or not.Here, I am trying to increase profits up to some extent as NPA (Non-Performing Asset) will be reduced due to loan disbursal for only creditworthy borrowers.

Completed Steps:
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Cross validation
* Selection of Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
* Evaluation of Models

Outcome: I am being able to reduce the False Positive Errors of such loan prediction problem completely using Gradient Boosting Model,
         which is a great advantage for the PeerLoanKart financial company and its customers as well.
